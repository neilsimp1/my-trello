This is a POC to prove that an Trello app created using Electron can function on Windows when using an HTTP proxy.

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/neilsimp1/my-trello.git
cd my-trello
npm install
npm start
```

This should launch a simple Trello window that lets you log in and use Trello, and *still works when Windows is working under an HTTP proxy*.
